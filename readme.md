# Hot Date for Melody and Movable Type

Do you schedule entries, or otherwise modify the Entry Date field? Do you sometimes forget a leading zero, for example, to create a valid, two-digit hour field? Hot Date is just what you need: drop-down time selectors in 12-hour format along with a few other features that make setting the date a breeze!

* Schedule according to the 12-hour clock with am/pm selectors you’re familiar with, rather than 24-hour time.
* Disable the “seconds” display because, really, does it matter what second you publish at? (A selectable option.)
* Work with an abbreviated minute list in five-minute increments. (A selectable option.)
* Refresh the time to be current with the green arrows button.
